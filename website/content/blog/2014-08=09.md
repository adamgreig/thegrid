We've been working on a piece of software to make it easy to edit the
non-interactive grid patterns, especially ones we want syncrhonised to music.
That software is now ready for use!

It works by defining frames at any point in time, which can contain any
pattern, and making it as easy as possible to create and edit frames, including
beat synchronisation. It's programmed in Python using the Pyglet library and a
handful of OpenGL.
