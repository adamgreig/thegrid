So, yet more exciting things are on the way, this time in the form of two
sample rolls of LED strip.  We couldn't decide whether "Pure/Day White" or
"Cool White" sounded more appropriate, so we're going to check out both.

In other news, the electronics design is significantly taking shape.  After a
number of iterations and a lot of discussion, we decided we want high-side
driving of the LED strip, and therefore P-channel MOSFET drivers.  This
would've required another row of transistors to interface between our shift
registers and the MOSFETs, except for Matt's (thanks!) neat idea of using shift
registers with open-drain drivers.  Prototype parts ETA tomorrow, so we'll see
how the idea stands up to testing.
