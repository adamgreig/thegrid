Title: Rework and a PCB

Having made surprisingly short work of reworking the first power supply, a blob
of epoxy sealed the deal.  Testing will have to wait until we get a few more
parts, but it looks good.

We had a number of interesting ideas for making the electronics easier.
Instead of using an Arduino to talk over USB and drive the shift registers (and
have yet another layer of software in the stack), it turns out you can use
several of the pins on an FTDI ft232r as GPIOs and use it to drive shift
registers directly.

Later in the evening, I was making a quick stripboard prototype with a shift
register and some PMOSes and complaining bitterly to Adam about cutting
stripboard tracks.  We shortly decided that it was, in fact, a rather good idea
to make a PCB.  Instead of one massive PCB, we could break it down to 7 PCBs,
each with a shift register and 7 outputs.  We can cascade the boards' shift
registers and connect each board directly to a power supply.  Surprisingly
quickly, the schematic looked something like this:

This all just about barely fits on a 5cm x 5cm PCB: (surface mount resistors
omitted for clarity, but they look like they'd fit...)

Using a 10cm x 5cm board, everything gets a lot more comfortable, a looks a
little like:

As a bonus, with the PCBs all lined up the LEDs will look something like a
grid.  In the end we went back to using through-hole components for everything.
Surface mount resistors would be smaller and cheaper, but through-hole is a lot
more fun.
