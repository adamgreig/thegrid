Title: Integration Testing

I got impatient of waiting for the full set of parts to complete the
electronics and put a board together with some components I had lying around.

I only had two MOSFETs and was lacking in connectors, but it was enough to
test.  Everything fit beautifully and soldered up well.

Wanting to test things, I connected the board to an [Arduino
Leonardo](arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoLeonardo) with some basic test code, and
it worked!  It only took a short while more to write the Leonardo firmware to
accept frames over USB CDC and drive the shift registers appropriately.  It
took an even shorter while to write a sink plugin for the control software.

That blurry image might not look like much, but it's a pretty significant
result.  The prototype PCB is driving two of our LED strips, powered by the
rebuilt power supplies.  The board was controlled by the control software via
the Arduino Leonardo.
