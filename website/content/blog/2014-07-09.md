After some more wrangling with the online vehicle tracking, we eventually had a
firm ETA... in the past. It slipped slowly further back in time until the
estimated delivery was an hour ago.

Luckily the aluminium did eventually make it to the present time and we happily
took delivery.

A few hours of hard sawing, filing and taping up later, and we now have eight
bundles of aluminium angle, all ready to be used for the structural component
of TheGrid.

We also opened up one of the power supplies to investigate the design and
quality. True to the "Professional" sticker on the box, the insides included a
large toroid that had torn free of its soldering, so we'll probably need to do
a little rework before these are shipshape.

The rest of the prototype electronics have also arrived, so we're ready to
start testing the control electronics. Hopefully the first LEDs (to verify
colour choice) will be arriving tomorrow so we can light something up!
