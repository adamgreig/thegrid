I received a lot of parcels today!  The LEDs, thermal compound, some relays,
and what we have affectionately termed The Danger Cable:

At first we weren't convinced the LED strips would be bright enough.  A quick
test in the garden cleared any doubts about the brightness:

Finally, I finished putting the power supply back together after a good clean
and a fresh dab of thermal grease.  After a little sanity testing, we thought
we'd give it some load:

The power supply seems to work beautifully, although it was only pushing 4A out
of its rated 30A!
