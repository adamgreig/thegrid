I've been extraordinarily busy!  First, I've finished filling all the PCBs,
shown here in the flight case with my Arduino Leonardo clone, the spare PCB and
the prototype PCB:

More recently, I laser cut some beautiful rings to assist with guying of the
camera mast:

I also finished cutting all the cable into correct lengths:

Hopefully tomorrow we'll be getting started on the computer vision code...
