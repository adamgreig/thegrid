Title: Finished prototype PCB

Having received the rest of my prototype parts, I finished off the prototype
board:

I'm very happy with the connectors (Pro Power's minipower series).  The PCB
headers are very solid and the locking mechanism is reassuringly significant.

I took the opportunity to put some connectors on LED strips and do some more
load testing.

The board quite happily powered its 35m of LED strip and only
got moderately warm after 15 minutes.  Conditions will be less ideal with 7
boards mounted vertically and close together, but I don't plan to be holding
all the LEDs turned on for extended periods!

I've now ordered all the parts to build the rest of the boards along with all
the cabling.  There are still some things left to acquire, but this is the last
significant purchase.
