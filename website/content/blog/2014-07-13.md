Another busy day. Further software refinements led to a Tkinter-based sink to
make visualisation easier:

I also stuck together a simple sink using pylibftdi in bitbang mode, which was
even easier than I expected. It generates the DATA, SRCK and RCK signals for
the shift registers using three pins on the FTDI.

Meanwhile David was busy finishing up the PCB design (more on that later).
Afterwards he stuck together the prototype electronics on a breadboard,
connected up the relays and two (of the eventual 49) LED strips and we tried
hooking it all up for the first time.

It all worked! Additionally the relays sounded great on one of the aluminium
poles. This is a very positive result and we're now confident that the
electronics design, software design, and various other choices that led to this
moment were at least on the right track.  All that's left is the actual PCBs,
the hard parts of the software (person tracking!) and a million other
tasks-to-do before EMF.
