The PCBs arrived!  They are looking beautiful in yellow silk with shiny HASL
finish.  Considering how much Dirty PCBs downplay their quality, these boards
are excellent.  I can't fault anything on the copper, and the soldermask looks
great.  Registration isn't amazing on the drill hits and silk, but it's still
very good.  The silk is iffy in places, but that was expected.  Now all we have
to do is wait for the full complement of components.

Thanks to [Dirty PCBs](http://dirtypcbs.com/) for excellent service and
excellent boards -- we'll be back for our next project!
