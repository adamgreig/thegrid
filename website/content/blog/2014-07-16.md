The LEDs turned up! Â£300, 250m, 7500 LEDs, in one unassuming box:

We opened it up, and sure enough, 50 individually bagged reels of 5m LED strip:

Obviously we had to test all 50 to be sure they were in fine working order, so
we sat down and got to it.

I'm happy to report that every LED functioned correctly. Hurray!
