This is all feeling much more real now as we've just placed the order for 35 5m
lengths of aluminium equal angle. It should arrive Tuesday, apparently! I can
only imagine how confused the delivery driver will be when the address is a
residental house.

We've now also finished the prototype design for the control electronics and
ordered a few samples to test drive. Hopefully we'll have flashing LEDs by the
end of the week.
