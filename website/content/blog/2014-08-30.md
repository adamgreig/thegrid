Title: Welcome to EMF!

Welcome to EMF! A lot of you will have seen us setup last night for a few
hours, so thanks to everybody who dropped by.  Hopefully later today we'll set
up again and keep running continuously for the rest of the weekend.  Also,
we're hoping to get the interactivity working by tonight.

More importantly, here's how to get started contributing your own patterns.
All of our code is available at [Our
github](https://www.github.com/cillian64/thegrid/).  This includes a number of
patterns which you can copy and modify, and everything you need to test them
out on your own laptop.  Once you're happy, make a pull request against our
repository and we'll include the good ones.

If you want to get in contact with us, drop an email to
[the.grid@drhouse.me.uk](mailto:the.grid@drhouse.me.uk), tweet us at
[__thegrid](https://www.twitter.com/__thegrid), or come find us at HABville or
milling around TheÂ·Grid.
