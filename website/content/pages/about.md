Discover an immersive art/engineering installation comprising a forest of
radiant "trees". As you move through the·grid it senses your presence and
initiates a ripple of light and a susurration of subtle clicks, propagating
through the system.  Traverse your own maze of light or stand back and enjoy
the spectacle.

Welcome to The·Grid.
