PSUs:
-----
Ordered from ebay

Flight Case:
-----------
Farnell TLTC1 -
http://onecall.farnell.com/duratool/d01817/aluminium-tool-case/dp/TLTC1 is
about 21 quid.

Drivers:
--------
Small NPN BJT first stage: BC337-25, farnell 1228215.  5.7p list.  All within
spec, pretty standard, should be fine!

PMOS second stage: FQP7P06 is 33p list, TO220.  Only problem is .4ohm gives
almost a watt dissipation and 60deg rise junction to ambient.  So, use Farnell
1611415, 24K/W resistance for 19.11 pence in 10off.  10 quid for the lot and
45deg continuous-on is no problemo.

Spoke to Matt, he reckons SOT23 and SOT233 are fine to mount on stripboard, and
can be gotten for 9p or so... That makes a dent. But can't heatsink them.
Open collector shift register would make life a lot easier but the only
through-hole part is 3 quid. There's a SOIC16 version for 70p but that's not
really strip friendly

1470497 is a nice shift register which costs 1.33 and has chunky open drain
outputs which can drive the PMOS directly.

Indicator LEDs:
---------------
The most boring LED that farnell sells: 2335729, 4.1pence in quantity

Resistors:
----------
For indicator LEDs, 600ohm .25W: 0.9p TE Connectivity, Farnell 2329545
MOSFET Gate pullup: 10k is sensible (1us time constant), power is no problem,
so 1692465 is .1p in quantity.
